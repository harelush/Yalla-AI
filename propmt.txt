You are building a fully responsive, RTL, mobile-first landing page in Next.js + Tailwind CSS.

### 1️⃣ General Rules
- All copy is **pulled from JSON** only. No hardcoded text anywhere.
- Use **gender-neutral Hebrew microcopy** (e.g., "שליחה" instead of "שלח").
- Design with a **futuristic, technological vibe** and smooth animations.
- Content tone: persuasive but short, with a stronger sales push.
- Keep **one unified message** (no segmentation by audience in UI).
- Use **modern microcopy** and emphasize places left instead of countdown timers.
- Logo & media: use placeholders.
- Floating sticky CTA button at the bottom of the screen on mobile.

### 2️⃣ RTL Support
- The entire site is **Right-to-Left** by default.
- `<html dir="rtl" lang="he">` in `_document.js`.
- Configure Tailwind with `tailwindcss-rtl` plugin (or logical properties).
- Text aligned right by default, numbers left-aligned.
- Use CSS logical properties (`margin-inline-start`, etc.) for safe RTL layouts.

### 3️⃣ Mobile-first Responsive
- **Design mobile-first** — optimize for small screens first, then scale up.
- Mobile:
  - Hero image/video stacked above text.
  - Navigation collapses into hamburger.
  - Sticky CTA at bottom viewport.
  - Form fields stacked, large tap areas.
- Desktop:
  - Grid-based layouts for features/testimonials.
  - Hero: side-by-side text + media.
- Handle overflow for long Hebrew words.

### 4️⃣ Accessibility
- All interactive elements have Hebrew `aria-label` or visible labels.
- WCAG AA color contrast compliance.
- Full keyboard navigation support.
- Form inputs linked with labels via `htmlFor`.

### 5️⃣ Colors
#1b0c3d – Deep navy purple (background dominant)
#3e2d69 – Dark violet-purple
#38d273 – Bright green (for “Educators” text)
#6f56fc – Bright violet (buttons)
#ffffff – White (text/icons)
#f6f6f6 – Light gray (secondary backgrounds)
#f04960 – Bright pinkish-red (badges/highlights)
#fea500 – Bright orange-yellow (icons/accents)
#ffdb4c – Yellow-gold (rating stars)
#141414 – Very dark gray (text/icons)


### 6️⃣ Animations
- Smooth, futuristic hover and scroll animations.
- Avoid overuse — focus on enhancing key CTA and hero section.

### 7️⃣ Forms & API
- Forms send data to a **mock API endpoint**.
- Include inline validation and Hebrew error messages.
- Show success message after submission.

### 8️⃣ Structure
- Sections (all text from JSON):
  1. Hero with headline, subheadline, CTA
  2. Benefits grid
  3. Testimonials
  4. Program details
  5. FAQ
  6. Signup form with CTA
- JSON structure must allow future language swaps.
- Use modern persuasive microcopy, short and impactful.

### 9️⃣ Technical
- Next.js + TailwindCSS (with `tailwindcss-rtl`)
- Use responsive Tailwind utilities (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`)
- Placeholders for logo and media
- Avoid any inline styles — only Tailwind classes
